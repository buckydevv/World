Privacy Policy for World Bot

Thanks for using World, a Discord bot that offers a range of great features. Here's what you need to know about how we handle your data!

What We Collect
We only store what’s needed for the bot to work properly. This includes:

Your Discord ID and username

Server and channel IDs

Some basic server logs (like message edits/deletes or joins/goodbyes)

We don’t collect any sensitive info like passwords or emails!

Why We Store It
We save this stuff so the bot can:

Remember your economy progress

Save your playlists

Keep track of some server activity if logging is on

Basically, it's all so your experience using the bot is smooth and consistent.

Where It's Stored
Everything is stored in a secure MongoDB database. We keep it safe and only use it for the bot's features.

Third-Party Stuff
We sometimes use external APIs (like for music, games, or fun commands). They might process stuff like a song name or search term, but we don’t give them your saved data.

Removing Your Data
You can remove your data whenever you want. Just use the built-in commands or contact the dev in the support server.
